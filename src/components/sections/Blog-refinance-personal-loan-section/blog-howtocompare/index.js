                          Here’s how to do it:

                          <span style={{ color: '#454545', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>APRs</span>: The APR (Annual Percentage Rate) of a personal loan encompasses the complete cost of the loan, incorporating both the interest rate and any associated fees. It's crucial to focus on this metric as it can significantly impact the total amount you repay throughout the loan term.

                          <span style={{ color: '#454545', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Loan terms</span>: The loan term refers to the total amount of time you have to repay your loan. Long-term personal loans typically come with lower monthly payments, but you’ll likely pay more in interest charges overall. Short-term loans will allow you to save on interest, but your monthly payment will be higher.

                          <span style={{ color: '#454545', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Funding time</span>: Each lender operates on its unique funding timeline. Some lenders can provide same-day funding, whereas others may take several days to process your request. It's essential to ensure that the lender's timeline aligns with your schedule before finalizing the agreement.
